I am a full-stack software engineer at Easy Labs - a Fintech startup that is building a better payment solution.

Prior to Easy Labs, I was a software engineer at We Sparkle where I built tools for entrepreneurs to promote & grow their businesses. I was also a HCI researcher that optimized Google Blockly interface with Macalester College & University of Washington research groups. 

I enjoy exploring, learning & colloborating. Hit my up (chialunyo@gmail.com) if you have fun ideas / opportunities. And if I'm not working, I'm probably making music stuff, climbing, lifting, and exploring things.
